# Git Commands & Terminology
- **Repository**
  - Definition: A repository is a directory or storage space where your projects can live. Users shorten this to “repo.” It can be local to a folder on your computer, or it can be a storage space on GitHub or another online host. You can keep code files, text files, image files, you name it, inside a repository.
  - Example
- **Clone**
  - Definition: Git clone is a Git command line utility which is used to target an existing repository and create a clone, or copy of the target repository. Cloning a local or remote repository. Cloning a bare repository. Using shallow options to partially clone repositories.
  - Example
- **Fork**
  - Definition: Creating a fork is producing a personal copy of someone else's project. Forks act as a sort of bridge between the original repository and your personal copy. You can submit Pull Requests to help make other people's projects better by offering your changes up to the original project.

- **Push**
  - Definition: The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repo. It's the counterpart to git fetch , but whereas fetching imports commits to local branches, pushing exports commits to remote branches.

- **Pull** 
  - Definition: The git pull command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content. Merging remote upstream changes into your local repository is a common task in Git-based collaboration work flows.

- **Remote Add / Remove / Show**
  - Definition: The "add" command marks changes to be included in the next commit. / Git rm is used to remove a file from a Git repository. It is a convenience method that combines the effect of the default shell rm command with git add. / git-show is a command line utility that is used to view expanded details on Git objects such as blobs, trees, tags, and commits.
- **Status**
  - Definition: The git status command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. It lets you see which changes have been staged, which haven’t, and which files aren’t being tracked by Git.

- **Master Branch**
  - Definition: A branch in **Git** is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits. The default branch name in **Git** is **master**. As you start making commits, you're given a **master** **branch** that points to the last commit you made. Every time you commit, the **master** **branch** pointer moves forward automatically.
