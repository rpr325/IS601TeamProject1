- Master Branch
  - Definition: A branch in **Git** is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits. The default branch name in **Git** is **master**. As you start making commits, you're given a **master** **branch** that points to the last commit you made. Every time you commit, the **master** **branch** pointer moves forward automatically.
