# Git Commands & Terminology
- **Repository**
  - Definition: A repository is a directory or storage space where your projects can live. Users shorten this to “repo.” It can be local to a folder on your computer, or it can be a storage space on GitHub or another online host. You can keep code files, text files, image files, you name it, inside a repository.

- **Checkout**
  - Definition: Updates files in the working tree to match the version in the index or the specified tree. If no pathspec was given, git checkout will also update HEAD to set the specified branch as the current branch.

- **Push**
  - Definition: The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repo. It's the counterpart to git fetch , but whereas fetching imports commits to local branches, pushing exports commits to remote branches.

- **Pull** 
  - Definition: The git pull command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content. Merging remote upstream changes into your local repository is a common task in Git-based collaboration work flows.

- **Remote Add / Remove / Show**
  - Definition: The "add" command marks changes to be included in the next commit. / Git rm is used to remove a file from a Git repository. It is a convenience method that combines the effect of the default shell rm command with git add. / git-show is a command line utility that is used to view expanded details on Git objects such as blobs, trees, tags, and commits.
- **Status** 
  - Definition: The git status command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. It lets you see which changes have been staged, which haven’t, and which files aren’t being tracked by Git.

- **Master Branch**
  - Definition: A branch in **Git** is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits. The default branch name in **Git** is **master**. As you start making commits, you're given a **master** **branch** that points to the last commit you made. Every time you commit, the **master** **branch** pointer moves forward automatically.
