# Project Description
Collaborative tools like Git, Docker, automated testing (For this project, you need to explain how the usage of Git, Docker, automated testing, and continuous integration can improve the productivity and competitiveness of a company.
## Git
Git is the most commonly used version control system. Git tracks the changes you make to files, so you have a record of what has been done, and you can revert to specific versions should you ever need to. Git also makes collaboration easier, allowing changes by multiple people to all be merged into one source. 
## Docker
Docker simplifies and accelerates your workflow, while giving developers the freedom to innovate with their choice of tools, application stacks, and deployment environments for each project.
## Automated Testing
Automated testing is, well, automated. This differs from manual testing where a human being is responsible for single-handedly testing the functionality of the software in the way a user would. Because automated testing is done through an automation tool, less time is needed in exploratory tests and
## Continuous Integration
Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently, preferably several times a day. Each integration can then be verified by an automated build and automated tests. While automated testing is not strictly part of CI it is typically implied.
## Activity Designations
**Feature**:  Added definition of the term repository.

**Fix**: Updated definition of repository

**Task**: Uploaded an image screenshot for a repository
